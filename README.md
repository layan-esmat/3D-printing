Robot Arm Joint - 3D Design
This project showcases a 3D mechanical design of a robot arm joint, modeled using Onshape, a cloud-based CAD platform. The joint is intended to be a modular part of a robotic arm and allows for basic rotational movement, simulating the function of a real robotic elbow or wrist joint.

 Design Features
Rotational Joint: Allows angular movement between connected arm segments.

Modular Design: Can be connected to other joints or robotic parts.

Hollow Center: Allows wiring or mechanical components (like servos or bearings) to pass through.

Bolt and Hole Integration: Includes holes for fasteners to secure the joint.

Realistic Measurements: Designed to reflect actual manufacturing standards.

  Tools Used
CAD Software: Onshape

Design Method: Parametric modeling with sketches, extrusions, and Boolean operations.
